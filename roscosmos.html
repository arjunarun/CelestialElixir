				The Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities commonly known as Roscosmos (Russian: Роскосмос), is a state corporation responsible for the space flight and cosmonautics program for the Russian Federation. Originally established as the Federal Space Agency, the agency evolved and consolidated itself from an independent state enterprise to the national megacorporation on 28 December 2015 through a presidential decree. When reorganized in 1992, Roscosmos was originally known as the Russian Aviation and Space Agency. The headquarters of Roscosmos are located in Moscow, while the main Mission Control space center is located in the nearby city of Korolev. The Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center is in Star City, also in Moscow Oblast. The launch facilities used are Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan (with most launches taking place there, both manned and unmanned), and Vostochny Cosmodrome being built in the Russian Far East in Amur Oblast.

		<h2>World's First Satellite</h2>
		<div class="Sputnik1">
				<div class="sputnik1Details">
					<p>On Oct. 4, 1957, Sputnik 1 successfully launched and entered Earth's orbit. Thus, began the space age. The successful launch shocked the world, giving the former Soviet Union the distinction of putting the first human-made object into space. The word 'Sputnik' originally meant 'fellow traveler,' but has become synonymous with 'satellite' in modern Russian. The pressurized sphere made of aluminum alloy had five primary scientific objectives: Test the method of placing an artificial satellite into Earth orbit; provide information on the density of the atmosphere by calculating its lifetime in orbit; test radio and optical methods of orbital tracking; determine the effects of radio wave propagation though the atmosphere; and, check principles of pressurization used on the satellites.</p>

		<h2>First Man In Space</h2>
		<div class="Sputnik1">
				<div class="sputnik1Details">
					<p>Yuri Gagarin was the first person to fly in space. His flight, on April 12, 1961, lasted 108 minutes as he circled the Earth for a little more than one orbit in the Soviet Union's Vostok spacecraft. Following the flight, Gagarin became a cultural hero in the Soviet Union. Even today, more than six decades after the historic flight, Gagarin is widely celebrated in Russian space museums, with numerous artifacts, busts and statues displayed in his honor. His remains are buried at the Kremlin in Moscow, and part of his spacecraft is on display at the RKK Energiya museum. Gagarin's flight came at a time when the United States and the Soviet Union were competing for technological supremacy in space. The Soviet Union had already sent the first artificial satellite, called Sputnik, into space in October 1957. Before Gagarin's mission, the Soviets sent a test flight into space using a prototype of the Vostok spacecraft. During this flight, they sent a life-size dummy called Ivan Ivanovich and a dog named Zvezdochka into space. After the test flight, the Soviet's considered the vessel fit to take a human into space.</p>

		<h2>First Woman In Space</h2>
		<div class="Sputnik1">
				<div class="sputnik1Details">
					<p>Valentina Tereshkova was the first woman to go into space. In 1963, she spent almost three days in space and orbited Earth 48 times in her space capsule, Vostok 6. That was her only trip into space. Tereshkova later toured the world to promote Soviet science and became involved in Soviet politics. An error in the spacecraft's automatic navigation software caused the ship to move away from Earth, according to the RT news channel. Tereshkova noticed this and Soviet scientists quickly developed a new landing algorithm. Tereshkova landed safely but received a bruise on her face. She landed in the Altay region near today's Kazakhstan-Mongolia-China border. Villagers helped Tereshkova out of her spacesuit and asked her to join them for dinner. She accepted, and was later reprimanded for violating the rules and not undergoing medical tests first. However, Tereshkova was honored with the title Hero of the Soviet Union. She received the Order of Lenin and the Gold Star Medal. She became a spokesperson for the Soviet Union and while fulfilling this role, she received the United Nations Gold Medal of Peace.</p>

		<h2>First Spacecraft to moon</h2>
		<div class="Sputnik1">
				<div class="sputnik1Details">
					<p>The Luna 1 spacecraft broke free of Earth’s gravity on 2nd January 1959, to head towards the moon. Many believe this craft – launched by the Soviet Union – was supposed to hit the moon. If it had, it would have been a large coup for the Soviets during the early days of the Space Race with the United States. It didn’t strike the moon, but it did fly successfully past Earth’s neighbor on January 4, 1959. It zoomed past the moon at a distance of 3,725 miles (5,995 km) after a flight of 34 hours. Eventually, Luna 1 became the first spacecraft from Earth to go into orbit around our sun. A cool feature of Luna 1 was its release on January 3, 1959 of a large, glowing, orange trail of gas. The gas was visible over the Indian Ocean with the brightness of a 6th-magnitude; that’s the faintest star you can see with the eye alone. The gas turned out to be made of sodium vapor. It let astronomers track the spacecraft. It also served as an experiment on the behavior of gas in outer space. On its journey moonward, the 795-pound (360-kilogram) spacecraft also picked up new data on Earth’s mysterious Van Allen radiation belts – a zone of charged particles, held in place by Earth’s magnetic field – which had been discovered only a year before.</p>
