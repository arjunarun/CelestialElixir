      <p class="box">By all accounts, we seem to live in a universe whose arrow of time only goes in one direction - forward. Whether we like it or not, adventurous journeys into ancient history may forever remain a mere figment of human imagination. But what if we had the opportunity to travel back in time? We could live through yesterday or the year 2000. We could participate in World War,  spectate the development of first civilizations, or even observe the formulation of our own planet. But how far would we be able to go? If our universe were static and eternal, we could travel as long as we would like. But from what we know we do not live in such a universe. That is to say, on your journey, we would eventually arrive at the very beginning of time.</p>

      <p class="box">The Big Bang was not an explosion in space, as the theory's name might suggest. Instead, it was the appearance of space everywhere in the universe, researchers have said. According to the Big Bang theory, the universe was born as a very hot, very dense, single point in space. Cosmologists are unsure what happened before this moment, but with sophisticated space missions, ground-based telescopes and complicated calculations, scientists have been working to paint a clearer picture of the early universe and its formation. A key part of this comes from observations of the cosmic microwave background, which contains the afterglow of light and radiation left over from the Big Bang. This relic of the Big Bang pervades the universe and is visible to microwave detectors, which allows scientists to piece together clues of the early universe. In 2001, NASA launched the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) mission to study the conditions as they existed in the early universe by measuring radiation from the cosmic microwave background. Among other discoveries, WMAP was able to determine the age of the universe — about 13.7 billion years old.</p>

      <p class="box">You might think that all the stars in the universe are just randomly scattered. Nah! Instead they are nicely grouped together. Galaxy is a group of many million stars, some gases and space dust. Now you know that, there is an invisible force (also called pull) that attracts any two objects found in the Universe. All the stars in the galaxy are held together by each other’s pull to form a large group.Galaxies are so big that we cannot measure it in kilometers or miles. So we use another measurement called a light year. Now what is a light year? We must leave it for now, and explain it to you another time!</p>
      <p class="box">Galaxies also come in many shapes and sizes. Our Milky Way is a spiral galaxy. Elliptical (egg shape) is another common shape for a galaxy like M87. Like how stars are collected together into galaxies, galaxies are collected together into clusters. The largest structures in the Universe are galaxy super clusters, which contain millions of galaxies and therefore trillion of stars. Some scientists say that there are more stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on every beach in the world. Whoa!</p>

      <p class="box">The Milky Way is the Galaxy in which we live. It is a spiral shaped galaxy that contains several hundred billion stars, including our Sun. It is about 100,000 light-years across and about 10,000 light-years thick. If you are at a place which has a very dark night sky, you can sometimes see the Milky Way as a thick band of stars in the sky. We live out in the suburbs of the Milky Way - not near the center, but not near the edge either.</p>
      <p class="box">The Milky Way contains hundreds of billions of stars like our sun. (And like our sun, most of these stars have at least one planet orbiting them.) Light at the galaxy’s center takes 25,000 light-years to travel from Earth. (A light-year is the distance light travels in one year.) So that means if you could see the core of the Milky Way, you’d be observing light that possibly left Earth before humans first settled in North America. At the center of the Milky Way is one of the strangest and deadliest things in the universe: a black hole. Black holes are born when a giant star runs out of energy. The star implodes, causing an explosion called a supernova. The star’s heart collapses under its own weight. It’s squashed into a tiny dot you can’t see. Scientists suspect a black hole lurks at the center of most galaxies. The Milky Way’s black hole is called Sagittarius A*. (A* is scientist-code for “A-star.”) Its gravity, or attractive force, is so strong that it pulls in anything that gets too close, including stars. The Andromeda galaxy is the closest galaxy to the Milky Way. And it’s about two million light-years away.</p>

      <h2 class="head2 animated bounceInLeft">The Solar System</h2>

      <p class="box">The solar system is the sun and everything that orbits around it. It includes the planets and their moons as well as numerous asteroids and comets. These objects are all held in orbit around the sun by the sun's strong gravity. Our solar system consists of an average star we call the Sun, the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. It includes: the satellites of the planets; numerous comets, asteroids, and meteoroids; and the interplanetary medium. The Sun is the richest source of electromagnetic energy (mostly in the form of heat and light) in the solar system. The Sun's nearest known stellar neighbor is a red dwarf star called Proxima Centauri, at a distance of 4.3 light years away. The whole solar system, together with the local stars visible on a clear night, orbits the center of our home galaxy, a spiral disk of 200 billion stars we call the Milky Way. The Milky Way has two small galaxies orbiting it nearby, which are visible from the southern hemisphere. They are called the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud. The nearest large galaxy is the Andromeda Galaxy. It is a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way but is 4 times as massive and is 2 million light years away. Our galaxy, one of billions of galaxies known, is traveling through intergalactic space.</p>
      <p class="box">The planets, most of the satellites of the planets and the asteroids revolve around the Sun in the same direction, in nearly circular orbits. When looking down from above the Sun's north pole, the planets orbit in a counter-clockwise direction. The planets orbit the Sun in or near the same plane, called the ecliptic. Pluto is a special case in that its orbit is the most highly inclined (18 degrees) and the most highly elliptical of all the planets. Because of this, for part of its orbit, Pluto is closer to the Sun than is Neptune. The axis of rotation for most of the planets is nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic. The exceptions are Uranus and Pluto, which are tipped on their sides.</p>

      <p class="box">Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. It is the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, oceans of liquid water on its surface, and, of course, life. Earth has a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers), and is round because gravity pulls matter into a ball, although it is not perfectly round, instead being more of an "oblate spheroid" whose spin causes it to be squashed at its poles and swollen at the equator. Roughly 71 percent of Earth's surface is covered by water, most of it in the oceans. About a fifth of Earth's atmosphereis made up of oxygen, produced by plants. While scientists have been studying our planet for centuries, much has been learned in recent decades by studying pictures of Earth from space.</p>
